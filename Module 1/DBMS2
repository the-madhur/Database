DBMS Software

There are various Database Management System (DBMS) software available that help in managing and manipulating data efficiently. Some commonly used DBMS software include:

MySQL
PostgreSQL (PgSQL)
Oracle SQL
SQLite

These DBMS software allow users to add, delete, update, and retrieve stored data efficiently.

Common Language - SQL
 All DBMS software understand a common language called SQL (Structured Query Language).

Role of SQL in DBMS

 1. A DBMS interacts with the stored database to manage data.
 2. To communicate with the DBMS, we use SQL, which acts as a programming language for databases.
 3. Each DBMS may have slight variations in SQL syntax, but the core language remains the same across all.

File-Based System (Traditional Data Storage)

 In earlier times, data was stored using a File-Based System, such as:

 Excel
 Word Documents (DOCX)
 Text Files

Problems with the File-Based System: 

 Data Redundancy – The same data is stored multiple times, leading to unnecessary duplication.
 Data Inconsistency – Updates in one file may not reflect in others, causing mismatched information.
 Difficult Data Access – Retrieving specific data is time-consuming and inefficient.
 Security Issues – Controlling access to sensitive data is challenging.

Introduction of Databases

 To overcome these limitations, Databases were introduced.

What is a Database?
 A Database is a collection of related data that is systematically stored and managed.

Advantages of Using a Database:

 Reduces Data Redundancy – Data is stored only once and can be referenced multiple times.
 Ensures Data Consistency – Updates are made in one place, preventing mismatched information.
 Enables Easy Data Access – Structured query languages (SQL) make retrieving data faster and more efficient.
 Enhances Security – Provides authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data.
 Facilitates Application Integration – Databases can easily integrate with various applications and software.

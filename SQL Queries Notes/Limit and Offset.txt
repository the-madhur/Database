Understanding LIMIT and OFFSET in MySQL

1. Basic SELECT * FROM actors;

This retrieves all rows from the actors table.
The output shows 5 records.

2. Using LIMIT

Query: SELECT * FROM actors LIMIT 2;

Explanation:
LIMIT 2 means only the first 2 rows will be retrieved.

Output:

Johnny Depp
Scarlett Johnson

3. Using LIMIT with OFFSET
Query: SELECT * FROM actors LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;

Explanation:
OFFSET 2 skips the first 2 records.
LIMIT 2 retrieves the next 2 records.

Output:

Chris Evans
Chris Hemsworth

4. Another example of LIMIT with OFFSET
Query: SELECT * FROM actors LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;

Explanation:
OFFSET 3 skips the first 3 records.
LIMIT 3 retrieves the next 3 records, but since there are only 2 records left, it returns:

Chris Hemsworth
Robert Downey Jr.

5. Observing Repeated Queries
You have similar queries with different LIMIT and OFFSET values:

Query	Skips (Offset)	Fetches (Limit)	Returned Rows
LIMIT 2	0	2	First 2 rows
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1	1	2	Rows 2 & 3
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2	2	2	Rows 3 & 4
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 3	3	2	Rows 4 & 5
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 1	1	3	Rows 2, 3 & 4
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2	2	3	Rows 3, 4 & 5

Summary

LIMIT restricts the number of rows retrieved.

OFFSET determines where to start fetching the rows.

OFFSET 0 is the same as not using OFFSET (fetches from the first row).

LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2 starts at row 3rd (index 2) and fetches 3 rows.

This is useful in pagination, where data is split into smaller parts for better performance.

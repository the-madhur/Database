Understanding SQL Queries in MySQL
1. Retrieving All Data from a Table
Query:

SELECT * FROM actors;
Explanation:
This retrieves all records from the actors table.

The table contains 5 rows with columns: Firstname, Lastname, Gender, and Netsworth.

2. Using LIMIT to Restrict Rows
Query:

SELECT * FROM actors LIMIT 2;
Explanation:
The LIMIT 2 clause ensures that only the first 2 rows are returned.

Output:

Johnny Depp

Scarlett Johnson

3. Using LIMIT with OFFSET to Skip Rows
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM actors LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
Explanation:
OFFSET 2 skips the first 2 rows.

LIMIT 2 retrieves the next 2 rows.

Output:

Chris Evans

Chris Hemsworth

Another Example
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM actors LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;
OFFSET 3 skips 3 rows.

LIMIT 3 fetches the next 3 rows, but only 2 rows remain.

Output:

Chris Hemsworth

Robert Downey Jr.

4. Using Aliases for Column Names
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT firstname AS first, lastname AS last FROM actors;
Explanation:
AS is used to rename columns in the result.

firstname becomes first and lastname becomes last.

Output:

first: Johnny, last: Depp

first: Scarlett, last: Johnson

first: Chris, last: Evans

first: Chris, last: Hemsworth

first: Robert, last: Downey Jr.

5. Viewing All Tables in a Database
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SHOW TABLES;
Explanation:
This command lists all tables inside the selected database.

Output:

The database contains one table: actors.

6. Summary Table of LIMIT and OFFSET
Query	Skips (Offset)	Fetches (Limit)	Returned Rows
LIMIT 2	0	2	First 2 rows
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1	1	2	Rows 2 & 3
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2	2	2	Rows 3 & 4
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 3	3	2	Rows 4 & 5
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 1	1	3	Rows 2, 3 & 4
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2	2	3	Rows 3, 4 & 5
7. Why Use LIMIT and OFFSET?
Efficient Data Retrieval: Useful when working with large datasets.

Pagination: Helps when displaying results page by page.

Performance Optimization: Reduces load on the database.

Understanding Primary Key and Auto-Incrementation in SQL
1. What is a Primary Key?
A Primary Key (PK) is a unique identifier for each row in a table.

It cannot contain NULL values and must be unique for every record.

It helps in efficiently retrieving, updating, and managing records.

2. What is Auto-Incrementation in SQL?
Auto-incrementation allows MySQL to automatically generate a unique numeric value for a column.

It is commonly used with the Primary Key to ensure each row has a unique identifier.

The AUTO_INCREMENT keyword is used with an integer column.

3. Creating a Table with an Auto-Incrementing Primary Key
CREATE TABLE actors (
    Firstname VARCHAR(20),
    Lastname VARCHAR(20),
    Gender VARCHAR(10),
    Networth INT,
    ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
);
Explanation:
ID is the Primary Key, meaning it uniquely identifies each row.

AUTO_INCREMENT ensures each new row gets a unique ID automatically.

4. Inserting Data and Auto-Incrementation Behavior
Inserting Data Without Specifying ID
INSERT INTO actors (Firstname, Lastname, Gender, Networth) 
VALUES ("Chris", "Evans", "Male", 600);
Since ID is auto-incrementing, MySQL assigns the next available number.

Manually Assigning an ID

INSERT INTO actors (Firstname, Lastname, Gender, Networth, ID) 
VALUES ("Chris", "Hemsworth", "Male", 800, 7);
Here, ID = 7 is explicitly assigned, overriding auto-incrementation.

5. Viewing the Table Data
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM actors;
Output Example:
Firstname	Lastname	Gender	Networth	ID
Chris	Evans	Male	600	1
Chris	Hemsworth	Male	800	7
Johnny	Depp	Male	500	8
Observations:
ID = 1 was auto-generated.

ID = 7 was manually assigned.

The next row got ID = 8, continuing from the highest ID, not 2.

6. Deleting a Record and Its Effect on Auto-Increment
sql
Copy
Edit
DELETE FROM actors WHERE ID = 8;
Updated Table Data:
Firstname	Lastname	Gender	Networth	ID
Chris	Evans	Male	600	1
Chris	Hemsworth	Male	800	7
Key Observations:
Row with ID = 8 is removed.

Auto-increment does not reuse deleted IDs!

If a new row is inserted, the next ID will continue from the highest existing value +1, not from 8.

7. Key Takeaways
✅ Primary Keys must be unique and non-null.
✅ Auto-incrementation ensures each row has a unique ID automatically.
✅ Manually assigning an ID skips auto-generated numbers.
✅ Auto-increment resumes from the highest existing ID, even if some are deleted.
✅ Deleted IDs are not reused unless explicitly reset.

8. Resetting Auto-Increment (Optional)
If you want to reset the auto-increment counter after deleting rows:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE actors AUTO_INCREMENT = 5;
This will make the next inserted row start from ID = 5, if it's not already occupied.

This should now fully cover Primary Keys, Auto-Incrementation, and Deletion Effects in SQL
